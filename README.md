# metmice
A programming language.


## How the language works ?
Basicly, it is half stack based, and half not.

There are three stacks : 
- the first one is for the output
- the second one is for computing
- the third one is for interracting with the system

There are also two types of computing : rpn and normal.

## How to start a new program
The first and most recommended thing to do when you create a ".mtmc" file is to include the standard librairie.
To do so, just write at the begining of your file : 
`include "./path/to/the/file/std.mtmc`

With that done, you can now use all the functions you will need !
